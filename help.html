<h3>Permutations</h3>

A permutation for drumming is a method for playing all the possible combinations of given instrument for a note division.   
The Groove Scribe can generate two types of permutations:  Kick drum and snare drum permutations in 1/16th notes.    
Any 1 measure ostinato can be used.   The "Permutation Options" allows you to turn on and off any of the individual sections.
<p>
If there are multiple measures present, all but the first will be closed when a permutation is activated.   
You can use the "Undo" action in the helpm menu to restore the measures that were closed if necessary.
<p>
For the Kick permutation, the "Simplify multiple kicks" option causes the kick on the "1" and the "1e" to be skipped if it 
directly follows a kick on the "4a" from the previous measure.   This usually makes the flow better if you are playing the whole 
pattern all the way through.
<p>
For the Snare permutatation the "Use Accent Grid" option changes the permutation to use all the 16ths notes on the snare and to accent 
the permutation pattern.
